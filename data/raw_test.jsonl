Background for those who don't know / forgot about it: Xiaomi locked the ability to use OEM Unlocking ability behind the Mi Account and Mi Unlocker tool. You would think just download the tool and unlock it? Not easy, in fact, they make you wait a week to get a token, sometimes even reject you for no apparent reason. You would also think just by toggling the setting on will resolve the issue? Nah, even if you toggle on the option in Developer Settings, it will just result in the same thing when you didn't have OEM Unlocking enabled in other brands. This directly violates the consumer rights, because we should have freedom over what we bought with our own money. Especially if you live in a democratic country. This is just pure violation to the Consumer Rights, especially EU considering them forcing every phone to have removable battery by 2027. I don't know, but I personally think this is outrageous for Custom ROM users like me. It is your right to use whatever OS you want on your phone. Locking it just means pure torture (kinda like Apple, but Im not going deep in this post, because Im afraid my post can be taken down). So, please help me and others Xiaomi users that are Custom ROM fans to spread this message. It would be greatly appreciacted!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1kl7jxp/", "upvotes": 52, "num_comments": 26, "source": "pullpush_sub", "fetched_at": "2025-10-21T15:44:27Z"}
