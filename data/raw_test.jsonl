Background for those who don't know / forgot about it: Xiaomi locked the ability to use OEM Unlocking ability behind the Mi Account and Mi Unlocker tool. You would think just download the tool and unlock it? Not easy, in fact, they make you wait a week to get a token, sometimes even reject you for no apparent reason. You would also think just by toggling the setting on will resolve the issue? Nah, even if you toggle on the option in Developer Settings, it will just result in the same thing when you didn't have OEM Unlocking enabled in other brands. This directly violates the consumer rights, because we should have freedom over what we bought with our own money. Especially if you live in a democratic country. This is just pure violation to the Consumer Rights, especially EU considering them forcing every phone to have removable battery by 2027. I don't know, but I personally think this is outrageous for Custom ROM users like me. It is your right to use whatever OS you want on your phone. Locking it just means pure torture (kinda like Apple, but Im not going deep in this post, because Im afraid my post can be taken down). So, please help me and others Xiaomi users that are Custom ROM fans to spread this message.

{"id": "1knkyvh", "subreddit": "r/Android", "created_utc": 1747347167.0, "title": "I know the struggle with Mathematics so I developed this APP", "selftext": "I grew up in a remote area where basic education felt like a luxury. Our school had limited resources, and math was always the biggest challenge—not because we weren’t curious, but because we didn’t have the right tools or guidance. Books were outdated, and most of us struggled with concepts beyond basic arithmetic. Years later, with a background in tech and a deep memory of that struggle, I had a crazy idea—what if we could build something smart enough to help students solve math problems, right from their phones? Something that doesn’t just give answers but shows steps, explains logic, and makes math feel less scary? That thought became a side project, then an obsession. I created a simple Android app powered by AI to scan math problems and generate clear, step-by-step solutions. I called it Math Magic Solver. But I didn’t want it to just sit on the Play Store—I wanted it to make a real difference. So, we bought a few budget tablets, loaded the app on them, and donated them to schools in under-resourced areas like the one I grew up in. Watching students tap on a screen and actually understand a math concept they’d been struggling with—that was the moment I knew it was worth every late night. Today, Math Magic Solver is live on the Google Play Store. It’s free, simple, and built with one purpose: to help anyone, anywhere, learn math a little easier. Sometimes, the best tech isn’t born in big offices or fancy labs—it starts with a struggle, a memory, and a little spark of an idea. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mathsolver.app", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/1knkyvh/", "upvotes": 0, "num_comments": 7, "source": "pullpush_sub", "fetched_at": "2025-10-21T16:09:45Z"}

My old SE had a chunk of memory that was, I believe, \"unknown\" due to corruption. My old routine was to do regular backups of photos and iPhone to my PC but it would take forever and backups often failed. I was always running out of phone space. After I got an iPad I decided to get iCloud to back it up -- it has my precious Procreate drawings that I never want to lose. However, these are (to my knowledge) inside a magical Procreate folder (or giant file). I may be incorrect on that. Anyway, tonight I was wondering if it would be possible for that folder/file to corrupt locally on my iPad and then back itself up as corrupted, thus ruining my chances of salvaging any of my drawings. My iPad is very healthy with space consumption and I use it way less than my phone. Still, the same question goes for my tens of thousands of photos and archived texts in iCloud. Is a corrupted iCloud file/backup even possible? Is there a way around it? I'm actually a PC user but know that Macs have Time Machine so I'd like to think that they'd enable some sort of save-state backup for instances like this.

We have his texts filtered into Known, Unknown. But he can’t stop himself from looking at the All folder, and there doesn’t seem to be a way to hide folders selectively.

She owns a small boutique and uses **WhatsApp Business** for handling clients and orders, and **regular WhatsApp** (Messenger) for personal communication. This setup is extremely common — separating personal and business chats is a basic use case. We used Apple’s *Move to iOS* app, and while it transferred WhatsApp Messenger data just fine, there was **no option to transfer WhatsApp Business data**. When I reset the phone and tried again to move Business instead, it warned that all existing data would be wiped — including the Messenger chats we just moved. So the problem is this: * You can transfer either WhatsApp or WhatsApp Business — **not both**. * Once one is transferred, doing the other requires a **factory reset**. * You **can’t restore** a WhatsApp Business Google Drive backup on iPhone either, which makes things worse. This means my mom had to either: 1. Give up her personal chat history (Messenger), 2. Or lose her years of business communication, including important client info, images, and work records. Both options are terrible. And it’s not a niche use case — this is how many small businesses operate. I get that platform differences (Google Drive vs iCloud) make direct backup transfers tricky, but **why isn’t there at least an option to migrate both WhatsApp and WhatsApp Business together during the Move to iOS process**? Or at least allow app-by-app transfers without a full reset? Has anyone found a workaround or third-party method that doesn't involve factory resetting? Or is this just something Apple and WhatsApp haven't prioritized at all?

The app offers two distinct approaches: **1. Decision Sprint**: A comprehensive, multi-step process that encompasses criteria identification, option formulation, in-depth analysis, and structured recommendation. This approach is particularly well-suited for intricate and high-consequence decisions. These decisions require detailed analysis of multiple factors and involve various stakeholders, while carrying long-term or significant consequences, high costs or risks, and numerous nuanced options that need systematic trade-off evaluation, ultimately benefiting from user participation in defining and weighting the relevant criteria. The implied process leads to a series of steps including thorough criteria definition, comprehensive option generation, methodical scoring of options against established criteria using specialized tools, and finally delivering a synthesized recommendation based on this deep analysis. The user experience is more involved, demanding additional input and thoughtful reflection from the user throughout a potentially extended timeframe to ensure optimal decision outcomes. **2. Decision Dialogue**: A guided, conversational process employing Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) to swiftly collect user preferences and subsequently propose a recommendation. Appropriate for low-complexity, lower-stakes decisions. These decisions need quick resolution and involve limited variables or criteria, featuring straightforward choices with low risk or cost implications, while benefiting from rapid guided questioning that can be effectively addressed through a short series of multiple-choice questions, typically ranging from three to five. The implied process leads to interaction with the MCQ Framework, which employs adaptive multiple-choice questions to efficiently gather user preferences and promptly generate a tailored recommendation. The user experience is quick and guided, requiring minimal free-form input from the user, making it particularly suitable for time-sensitive situations or routine choices that don't demand extensive deliberation. **Additional Features:** * All decisions are stored in structured form in the decisions section and can be accessed anytime * Users can share their Decision Sprints to the community and gather feedback * Decision Sprint includes an option to chat with an AI Decision Mentor that answers questions specific to your decision * Create Tasklists for decisions, add notes, and more I don't want to add more features before understanding if this is useful for anyone. I would really appreciate any feedback on the app idea. Please check out the videos below to get a better understanding of how it works!

{"id": "1kq0eun", "subreddit": "r/AppIdeas", "created_utc": 1747619977.0, "title": "What if there was an app that paid you to answer quiz questions?", "selftext": "I've recently filed a provisional patent for a gamified trivia app called \"Quizziu\" that pays users cash incentives to answer quiz questions about products and services. The app serves as a dual-purpose platform: it provides companies with a cost-effective marketing tool to boost product awareness, and it offers users a fun, gamified way to earn money while discovering new products. How Quizziu WorksApp Interface: The home screen displays a list of trivia questions, each tied to a specific product or service.Next to each question is the incentive amount (e.g., $0.10–$1.00) for answering correctly. Questions are categorized by industry (e.g., travel, tech, fashion) for easy navigation. Question Selection and Gameplay: Users tap a question to open a new screen showing the trivia question and four multiple-choice answers.Users have one chance to select the correct answer, promoting focus and retention of product details.If the answer is correct, the incentive is instantly credited to the user’s in-app wallet. If incorrect, the user can move on to another question but cannot retry the same one. A “Learn More” link is provided with each question, directing users to the brand’s website or a brief product summary for research before answering. Incentive and Payout System: Incentives range from $0.10 to $1.00 per question, depending on the complexity and the brand’s budget. Users can cash out earnings via PayPal, Venmo, or gift cards once they reach a minimum threshold (e.g., $5). To prevent gaming the system, Quizziu uses anti-cheat measures like randomized question delivery and time limits for answering. Brand Campaign Setup: Companies submit their campaign details, including product information, target audience, and budget. Quizziu’s team crafts 5–10 trivia questions per campaign, each designed to highlight key product features or benefits. Brands set the incentive amount per question and the number of respondents they want to reach. For example: Budget: $100,000, 10 questions, each with a $0.25 incentive. Target: 360,000 respondents (e.g., 36,000 per question) Questions are distributed across the user base, with algorithms ensuring demographic alignment (e.g., age, location, interests). Example Scenario Bob’s Luggage Company launches a new line with a built-in tracking device, alarm, and smartphone app to prevent loss and theft. Bob partners with Quizziu for a $100,000 campaign. Quizziu creates a trivis question, such as: “What feature helps Bob’s new luggage prevent loss during travel?” A) Solar-powered charger B) Built-in tracking device, alarm, and smartphone app C) Waterproof fabric D) Expandable compartments Incentive: $0.25 Nancy, a Quizziu user, sees the question in her app. Unsure of the answer, she clicks the “Learn More” link, visits Bob’s website, and reads about the new luggage line with built in tracking device, alarm, and smartphone app. She returns, selects the correct answer (B), and earns $0.25. Weeks later, when her friend's son loses his luggage during a trip, Nancy recalls the trivia question, so she enthusiastically recommends Bob’s luggage to her friend, who then purchases it for her son, a sale directly influenced by Nancy's Quizziu experience. Unique Selling Points Engagement Over Boredom: Unlike traditional surveys, Quizziu’s trivia format is fun, quick, and rewarding, increasing user participation. Learning Through Incentives: The one-chance rule and research option encourage users to actively learn about products, improving brand recall. Cost-Effective Marketing: Brands pay only for correct answers, ensuring engagement with their message, and reach large audiences at a low cost per impression. Measurable Impact: Quizziu provides brands with analytics, including response rates, demographic breakdowns, and click-through rates to “Learn More” links. Scalable and Flexible: Campaigns can target niche or broad audiences, with adjustable budgets and incentive structures. Revenue Model: Quizziu charges brands a platform fee (e.g., 20% of the campaign budget) to cover question creation, distribution, and analytics. Additional premium services, like advanced targeting or custom question formats (e.g., video-based trivia), generate extra revenue. User-side monetization includes optional in-app purchases (e.g., premium question packs with higher incentives) or ad-supported free tiers. Potential Challenges and Solutions: Randomize answer order, impose time limits, and require a short delay before answering to encourage research. Ensuring brand trust in ROI. Provide detailed campaign reports and offer a small free trial campaign to demonstrate effectiveness. Gamify the experience with leaderboards, streaks, and bonus incentives for frequent participation. Social Sharing: Users can share trivia questions on social media, earning bonus incentives if friends join and answer correctly. AR Integration: For physical products, users can scan items in stores to unlock exclusive trivia questions. Loyalty Program: Users earn points for every question answered, redeemable for higher-value rewards or exclusive brand discounts. Impact Potential: Quizziu bridges the gap between market research and marketing, creating a win-win for brands and consumers. Brands gain a highly engaged audience, while users earn money and discover products they or someone they know, might genuinely need. With its scalable model, Quizziu could disrupt traditional survey platforms and become a go-to tool for product discovery in the digital age. Quizziu is a revolutionary mobile app poised to redefine how brands connect with consumers, and how individuals discover new products and services. In today's noisy digital landscape, traditional market research feels like a chore for consumers, and for brands, cutting through the clutter to achieve meaningful engagement is an ongoing challenge. Quizziu offers a fresh, dynamic solution: we're transforming tedious questionnaires into engaging trivia that pays users to learn about brands. Imagine a platform where market research isn't an obligation, but a fun, rewarding experience.\" \"At its core, Quizziu is a mobile app that incentivizes users to learn about products and services through engaging trivia questions.

This single attempt, coupled with an optional 'Learn More' link that directs them to the brand's website or a concise product summary, encourages focused engagement and genuine learning. Correct answers are instantly rewarded with credits to their in-app wallet, which can be cashed out via popular platforms like PayPal and Venmo once a small threshold is reached. We've also built in robust anti-cheat measures to ensure the integrity of the system.\" \"For brands, Quizziu offers a cost-effective and highly engaging marketing solution that goes far beyond traditional surveys. Instead of hoping users passively absorb information, brands actively incentivize them to learn key product features and benefits. They set their campaign parameters – budget, target audience, and incentive per question – and our platform handles the rest. Our team crafts compelling trivia questions designed to highlight crucial selling points. Brands only pay when a user answers correctly, ensuring that every dollar spent translates to active engagement with their message. Furthermore, Quizziu provides valuable analytics, including response rates, demographic breakdowns, and click-through rates to 'Learn More' links, offering actionable insights into campaign performance and consumer understanding.\" \"Quizziu stands out for several key reasons: * Engagement Over Boredom: We replace the drudgery of surveys with the fun and reward of trivia, significantly boosting user participation. * Learning Through Incentives: The one-chance rule and the 'Learn More' option actively encourage users to learn about products, leading to better brand recall and understanding. * Cost-Effective Marketing: Brands achieve high engagement at a low cost per impression, paying only for users who actively interact with their information. * Measurable Impact: Our platform provides detailed analytics, allowing brands to track their ROI and gain valuable consumer insights. * Scalability and Flexibility: Quizziu can accommodate campaigns of all sizes, targeting niche or broad audiences with adjustable budgets and incentives.\" \"Our revenue model is multi-faceted and designed for sustainable growth.

We also envision opportunities for premium brand services, such as advanced targeting and custom question formats. On the user side, we may explore optional in-app purchases for premium features or ad-supported free tiers, ensuring a balanced approach to monetization.\" \"While we are in the pre-launch phase, the initial concept has generated significant interest in market validation. Looking ahead, we see immense potential for Quizziu to evolve. We plan to incorporate features like social sharing for viral growth, augmented reality integrations for in-store engagement, and loyalty programs to reward consistent participation. Ultimately, Quizziu aims to become the go-to platform for product discovery in the digital age, bridging the gap between effective marketing and genuinely informed consumers.\" \"Quizziu isn't just another survey app; it's a dynamic marketing and learning platform with a unique value proposition for both users and brands. We believe it has the potential to disrupt traditional market research and create a powerful new channel for product discovery.

Color influences how users feel, trust, and engage with your interface. Understanding color psychology helps you create intentional, emotionally-driven design choices that guide user behavior. *Why Color Matters in app design : Humans react to color on both emotional and physiological levels. It can: Increase trust Evoke action (or hesitation) Enhance usability Improve user retention Each color triggers specific associations and feelings — and in mobile apps, this plays a major role in user interaction. *The Psychology of Key Colors : Blue – Trust, Calm, Stability # Most used in finance, health, and productivity apps. #Creates a sense of reliability and professionalism. #Example: PayPal, Facebook Why it works: It reduces anxiety and feels secure — essential in fintech and mental wellness. Red – Urgency, Passion, Attention #Stimulates action and excitement. #Used for, alerts, or urgency-driven apps like fitness or dating. #Example: YouTube, Tinder Caution: Overuse can cause stress or aggression. Green – Growth, Health, Balance #Associated with nature, money, and wellness. #deal for meditation, sustainability, or finance tracking apps. #Example: Headspace, Mint Bonus: Green is easy on the eyes — great for long-session usage. Yellow – Optimism, Energy, Caution #Grabs attention and creates a cheerful tone. #Used to highlight tips, onboarding steps, or reward systems. #Example: Snapchat Tip: Use sparingly — excessive yellow can feel overwhelming. Black/Dark Themes – Luxury, Power, Focus #Modern and sophisticated. HZelps reduce eye strain and highlights content visually. #Example: Netflix, Apple Music Psychological bonus: Creates a premium feel, often used in high-end or creative tools.

I also got this idea cuz nowadays only the catchy bits of songs go viral on tiktok. personally i get disappointed when i listen to the entire song cuz it doesn't hit the same way. I honestly got this idea cuz i wanted sumn like this to exist when i listen to songs. esp cuz of my love for song bridges and beat drops and all. but yea i just wanna know if its good enough cuz i think its very niche. any other ideas wud be nice as well. thanks!! Also some examples of parts ppl love listening to in songs: My eyes - Travis Scott \\[the ending fast rap\\] Tumblr girls- G-eazy \\[the ending part is so heavenly ifykyk\\] That's so true - Gracie Abrams \\[the bridge is viral af\\] APT - Rosé \\[the pre-chorus of the song\\] Many of taylor swift bridges haha So yea lemme know wht u think!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AppIdeas/comments/1kkm5j5/", "upvotes": 1, "num_comments": 0, "source": "pullpush_sub", "fetched_at": "2025-10-21T16:09:48Z"}

Let’s break it down step-by-step and spare your brain from the overwhelming mush of pure confusion. # How do you validate the idea? &gt;!Spoiler: You can’t. You validate products, not ideas.!&lt; Asking people, “Would you use X?” is useless. People lie, overpromise, or don’t know what they want. &gt;“If I had asked people what they wanted, they would have said faster horses.” – Henry Ford # So what do you do instead? Build a prototype or MVP that people can touch, use, or say no to. That’s the only way to test for real demand. You validate through: * Pre-sales / Waitlists (with a landing page + lead magnet) * Pilot testing with a controlled group * Manual onboarding calls to track usage * Low-effort prototypes using no-code or mock-ups If no one engages, clicks, or converts—it’s not the market’s fault. It’s the idea’s. # How do you build the product? Finding a tech co-founder is great... if you’re lucky, deathly persuasive, or dating one. But here’s the truth: Tech people aren’t short on work. Asking them to spend 6+ months on an idea with no proof is like asking a chef to cook a 5-course meal with a random stranger’s grocery list. With the promise that MAYBE he’ll get paid for it in the future. So what are your options? **Option 1: DIY no-code** Great if you have time and the idea is functionality-light. [Bubble.io](http://bubble.io) works **Option 2: Assemble a freelance team** Risky. You’ll juggle: * Sketchy talent (Fiverr is filled with fake reviews and UpWork is a game of who can bid the highest) * Bad project management * Inconsistent quality * And oh- you’re now also the PM, QA, UX lead, and CTO. Congratulations! **Option 3: Hire a dev agency** Better, but traditional tech firms will only help you with “building”. You’ll still be left alone to figure out market research, client acquisition &amp; retention and funding on your own. You’ll get a working product. But will it convert? Will users stay? Will it be scalable? Good luck finding out (I used to do the exact same thing until my recent pivot and the moment I helped 2 clients with their launch, look at me all up on high horse lmao) # What I do and why you should care I build MVPs that get users, generate revenue, and prove your idea works– fast. Not just code. Not a half-functioning app. A launch-ready product that includes: * A conversion-focused landing page that actually gets signups * A clean, fast full stack and scalable MVP that highlights your core value prop * Retention systems like onboarding flows, usage reminders, and in-app nudges * Launch support to get your first 100–10,000 users through proven, niche-specific channels. Early traction GUARANTEED * Tracking &amp; analytics so you can show traction to investors or double down on growth # How do I get users? I have partnered up with a marketing firm that specializes in user acquisition. And the methods depend on the product. But it always starts with a killer offer and airtight conversion focused messaging. Some low-cost but labour heavy strategies we’ve used for clients: * Targeted Reddit &amp; Slack outreach * Cold DMs + landing page funnels * Incentivized referral loops * Partnered shoutouts with micro-communities * Newsletter placements * Answering niche Quora/Reddit questions with value &amp; CTA * Pre-launch waitlist → beta group → PR loop * Traction that turns into proof for investors or revenue. For every MVP I ship, I personally handle getting their first 100–10,000 users. (The number of users depends greatly on the product- for example let’s say it’s a B2B software targeted towards companies with 500-1000 employees and the payment model is per user based then getting 100 sign ups for it would be a huge deal. Because say it’s priced $9/user/month and 100 employees use it per company then assuming we convert 20% of the 100 sign ups its- 9×100×20=18,000/month. Not bad for an early stage startup huh) But if it’s a free B2C app and we’re looking to monetize via ad revenue then 1000 downloads will probably be the goal The 2nd factor is obviously budget, if you have a budget of $30k for the whole thing, I’d be able to promise more results than if you have a budget of $10k. But the point is- more or less- there will always be result and it will always be more than you can achieve alone) And whether you continue with me or not — you keep the entire traction playbook we used to get you the early traction. # How do you get funding? If you’ve got: * A working MVP * Real users * Even early traction …you’re already 10x more fundable than someone with just a deck. But funding = research + positioning + storytelling + outreach. Here’s what I provide my clients: * Niche-specific investor lists * Customized pitch deck stacks * Help refining their narrative and financial roadmap * Warm intros via my incubator and founder network * Direct pitch consultation (or mock investor calls) 2 of the founders who came to me for MVPs recently have walked away with early users, revenue, and investor interest. You don’t need to know how to code, market, or pitch. You just need the right people to help you execute fast and smart. I’ve helped build **10+ MVPs this year alone**. But keeping it transparent- my portfolio for providing full stack help including user acquisition and funding consultation is limited- 2 startups, working on the 3rd and 4th. With that being said, if you’re working on something and need a MVP built + users onboarded + investor-ready pitch, send me a DM. Or [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/uwhebWuLfNNnCNKC7). My capacity is limited for now (6 projects/month, 2 spots already filled) so I might not be able to help everyone but whether you get onboarded as a client or not, I’ll be sure to send over any resources that I think might help you. **Everyone gets something!** Let’s Get Building!", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AppIdeas/comments/1ki4wag/", "upvotes": 1, "num_comments": 0, "source": "pullpush_sub", "fetched_at": "2025-10-21T16:09:48Z"}

For years, I tried to think of something valuable and looked for ways to find product ideas people would actually pay for. I think I’ve made real progress in understanding this process - and here’s what I’ve figured out: # 1. Niche Markets = Gold Mines Forget \"comfortable\" ideas like to-do apps. Instead: * Look for manual work: excel hell, copy-pasting, repetitive tasks. Every \"Export\" button is a $20/month SaaS opportunity. * Observe professionals: join subreddits like r/Accounting or r/Lawyertalk. Their daily frustrations are your next product.Example: someone spends hours compiling reports? Build a tool that does it in minutes. Charge $19/month. Profit. # 2. Steal Paul Graham’s Trick The best ideas come from your own problems. Why? * You understand the pain deeply. * If you suffer, others do too (check Reddit to confirm). # 3. Workarounds = Billion-Dollar Signals When people invent complex hacks (like tracking 20 SaaS subscriptions in Sheets), it means: * The problem is painful. * No good solution exists (or no one knows about it). # 4. Reddit = Free Idea Validation Top 10 posts in any professional subreddit will reveal: * People begging for tools that don’t exist (or suck). * Complaints about workarounds (Google Sheets hacks, duct-tape solutions).Actionable tip: find 10+ posts about the same pain point. Combine them into one killer product. These approaches help uncover real problems that people are willing to pay to solve. But even with them, doing everything manually is still too hard. So I decided to take it a step further and automate the process. I built a small app for myself that analyzes user posts to generate startup ideas. It even helps me search related insights to spot patterns - similar problems raised by different users. Try it, you might find some valuable ideas too. I’m building it in public, so I will be happy if you join me at [r/discovry](https://www.reddit.com/r/discovry/). TL;DR: Stop guessing.

You could download it, post it to Instagram/stories, or just keep it as a digital memento. The goal is to make the movie experience feel a bit more special, even if you're just watching at a regular theater. **Not talking NFTs, no blockchain, no AR/VR gimmicks, just a simple, nice-looking ticket image that feels** ***worth keeping*****.** Is this something you'd find fun or useful?

It’d be a video platform where users create a video to post for other users to see but there’s a twist. Here’s how it’d work: Your video will have a max of 24 hours to get likes and grow until either one of two things happen. A: Your video received enough likes to be in the Top 25 which will save it to your profile to be viewed again or… B: Your video did not manage to go viral and will be deleted. There would be 6, 24 hour blocks everyday where a user can post a video. Some will be prompt driven promoting users that may not be creative while others may be open so anything could be posted. They will vary in video length as well. Every 24 hour block would be a fresh slate. Regardless of your follower count, view count, like count, etc. your video would have the same likelihood to be seen as everyone else that has posted a video. And to make things more interesting once a user decides on what they want to make they are limited on the amount of time they have to record and edit their video before they have to either post it skip this block. Users will not be able to upload videos to the platform, they have to record and edit inside the app. At the start of each time block, the app will ask the user whether they want to record a video and compete in this block, skip posting and watch others’ posts, or wait. If the user chooses to wait, they won’t have the ability to see videos for that block until a decision is made. This will ensure that everyone comes up with their own ideas and can’t steal ideas from someone else’s video. You’ll have the opportunity to follow other creators and see their posts from their profile but only after the time block the video was posted in has expired. This will make it to where creators with large followings don’t have an advantage at making a viral video. There will be 3 tabs to choose where to watch from. - Discover: this is where every video starts. Regardless of likes every video will get the same amount of views. - Trending: once a video starts to build momentum (a good view to like ratio) their video will go here. This will be where users can find more polished videos that have already garnered popularity rather than scrolling through a random hodgepodge of videos of varying quality. This will allow a video to grow exponentially. - Top: Each 24 hour block will rank the top 25 videos with the most likes. These videos will be displayed here. If at the end of the 24 hours your video is here, it will be saved to your profile for others to view. The entire purpose of this app is every 4 hours there is a new opportunity for someone to go viral with everyone starting on an equal playing field. I don’t think there is anything like this out available now. All feedback is greatly appreciated whether it’s positive or negative. If anyone has any suggestions or tweaks I’d love to hear them!

I wanted to share a side-project I’ve been working on, which started from a very real problem of mine: I kept forgetting everything I read online during the day. I’d take breaks from work, read articles, newsletters, or random posts, but by the end of the day (or even a few hours later), it was like that information had vanished. A week later? Gone. I thought: what if I could save the most interesting things I read? But I quickly ran into two issues: my laziness and the friction of current tools. I tried using note-taking apps, but it felt tedious: copy the content, open the app, find the right place, paste, refactor the text, go back to reading… It didn’t last. Over time, I stopped saving things altogether. That’s when I decided to build something for myself. I wanted a tool that would let me: * Quickly save content from anywhere (browser, articles, PDFs…), * Organize and categorize it effortlessly, * And most importantly, generate automatic summaries so I could actually review what I read later. That’s how MemoraHub was born: [https://memorahub.com](https://memorahub.com) I used this project not only to solve a problem, but also to learn. I built the first version as a native app with Flutter (which I’d never used before), and the backend with Spring Boot (to sharpen my Java). Later, I made a simple landing page using Next.js. But I hit a wall when I realized I’d need to pay for Windows and macOS developer licenses just to distribute the app, on top of paying for the domain, hosting (on Railway), and even Gemini. So I made a shift: I turned Memorahub into a web app using React and browser extensions with JavaScript. I’m still actively improving it, and there's a lot more I want to add. And just to be fully transparent: yes, I used AI to help me build the app, especially for boring or repetitive tasks. I also used AI to help me write and refine this post, because putting myself out there is new to me and a bit scary 😅 But every line of code and every word was reviewed and shaped by me.

It’s kind of like Uber—but for quick, everyday tasks and favors. The idea came from a real experience: I had a truck full of furniture to unload and just needed someone to help. I tried everything—asking around in person, making calls—but no one was available or picking up. I ended up wasting nearly two hours just trying to find someone, with no luck. Then, two guys happened to be passing by. I asked if they knew anyone—or if they were up for the job themselves. They said, *“Why not? Easy money!”* It took them less than 20 minutes, and that’s when the idea clicked. There are people out there who are totally open to doing small, simple tasks for a bit of extra cash. And on the flip side, there are people (like me) who just need a helping hand now and then but don’t know who to ask—or don’t have time to search. Whether it’s moving a couch, picking something up, assembling furniture, or running a quick errand—**finding reliable, immediate help shouldn’t be so hard**. That’s the vision behind **QuickFavor**.

I have this idea for an app that I’d love to execute but basically no knowledge on how to do this. I’m hoping to find a team of people who may be interested :) this is the idea! I’d like to create an app that helps shoppers know where their product comes from or where it’s sourced without having to do a ton of research. Purpose: who owns the rights to the product, rate of ethical ness/sustainability of that company (facts provided), what alternatives you can buy that are better if any or how to make your own of that product if possible (doesn’t have to be 100% green, but maybe in the yellow or orange zone instead of the red zone) Fact checks: fact checks provided by none of the “big 6” news sources I acknowledge that sustainability is often associated with being “feminine” or “left wing” so I think it could also be advertised as a way of helping you to be “more healthy” and less chance of it being shadow banned on the App Store lol. Some examples of what I mean is like Nestle owns the rights to soooo many things like KitKats, haagandazs, etc and Nestle is such a god awful company. They own too many things to keep track of/memorize so I think it would be cool to have something somewhat similar to the layout of Google where you take a picture of a product or type the name in and it’ll tell you what’s what :) like if it has palm oils in the product, if the labor is ethical, etc. Any takers?? I’m very open to ideas and constructive criticism (as long as it’s done kindly) but really hoping to find some like minded individuals who could help me get this in the ground.

Here are **5 monetization mistakes** I see a lot. # 1. Showing the paywall too early (or too late) **Mistake**: Users see a paywall 5 seconds after launch — or only after digging through 10 screens. Either way, conversions tank. **Example fix**: A habit-tracking app I worked with moved the paywall to trigger *after the user added their first habit*. Conversion rate increased by **34%,** because value was felt *before* being asked to pay. # 2. Using flat, one-size-fits-all pricing **Mistake**: $4.99/month, no other options. Feels rigid, no perceived value. **Example fix**: We tested 3 tiers: monthly, annual (with 40% discount), and a “lifetime” one-time unlock. 70% of new purchases shifted to annual or lifetime. Revenue per user went up by **50%** with no extra traffic. # 3. Relying on ads when subs would work better **Mistake**: Flooding users with ads because “that’s what free apps do,” without testing pay options. **Example fix**: A casual game added a soft paywall: “Play unlimited levels ad-free for $2.99” after level 5. Players hated the ads, so this offer converted well. Ads remained for free users, but now **5–7%** converted to paid. # 4. Not offering a free trial **Mistake**: Paywall says “Subscribe now” with no preview or test. Huge drop-off. **Example fix**: A photo editing app added a 3-day free trial. They also improved onboarding to *highlight premium filters*. Trial starts after trying one premium feature. Trial-to-paid conversion hit **21%** — far better than the old paywall. # 5. No A/B testing on monetization flows **Mistake**: You tweak features, but never test pricing, timing, or layout of the paywall. **Example fix**: We ran a test with two paywall layouts — one focused on features, the other on emotions (“Unlock your creativity!”). The second version saw a **17% lift** in conversions. Tiny copy/layout changes = big revenue impact. Most indie apps I see could 2x their revenue with small tweaks — no need to scale UA yet.

It's not just an app experience, but something you can hold, read, and revisit. # Core Concept: You enter your birth date, time, and place, and Nordastro does a deep dive into your chart. It then generates a personalized book that covers your: * Personality traits, strengths, and challenges * Life path and long-term direction * Relationship style and compatibility insights * Career alignment and success tips * Personalized rituals and remedies * Plus extras like palmistry, numerology, crystals, tarot, and astrology basics There’s also a companion app that delivers daily guidance and compatibility checks with others. # Why it’s Different: Most astrology apps just give quick blurbs or daily horoscopes. Nordastro creates something deeper and more tangible — a full guidebook about *you*, based on your chart. It’s not a generic experience. It’s a mix of personalized content and ancient wisdom, made to last. Whether it’s for self-growth, relationships, or just curiosity, I think this idea could really resonate with people who want something more meaningful than just scrolling through daily zodiacs.

Even if the products are average or mediocre at best, they would at least have a dedicated user base right out of the gate, working to improve the concept and spread the word. **Most of us here lack the technical skills to make any of our ideas a reality, but I believe there are developers out there that will build something that comes pre-validated and pre-packaged with a large user base and beta testers**.

We start simple, something that can be made without too much difficulty, maybe even by one of us (I have some experience with Bubble). We put our heads together and turn it into a personal passion project, even if it doesn't align with our own interests.** When we have a finished product, we spread the word, and we grow the userbase. To avoid abandoning a product after it is launched, we can impose a minimum number of active users before starting a new project. **What do you say?

{"id": "1ke6tfd", "subreddit": "r/AppIdeas", "created_utc": 1746316937.0, "title": "App idea", "selftext": "Hi! I’m 16 and I had this idea for an app I’d love feedback on—or even help building if anyone’s interested. The Problem: At school, it’s hard to find people who truly share your interests—especially if you’re shy, new, or not part of a big social circle. Regular social apps can feel overwhelming, and anonymous ones often turn toxic fast. The Idea: An app that lets students at the same school anonymously connect through “clubs” based on their shared interests—like art, music taste, favorite shows, games, etc.—while keeping it safe, kind, and fun. How It Works: • School Verification: Users sign up with a school email (or code system) so they’re grouped with people from the same school. • Interest-Based Clubs: Think of each club like a mini Instagram page for things like “Art,” “Swifties,” “Marvel Fans,” or “Lofi Music.” Users can post anonymously or with a chosen username. • Anonymous Comments &amp; DMs: You can react and chat anonymously, but everything is heavily moderated. You can choose to “reveal” your identity to someone if you both agree. • Positive Culture: Daily prompts in clubs like “What’s your current favorite song?” or “Share your latest sketch.” Upvotes or badges reward positive interaction. • Anti-Bullying &amp; Safety: AI moderation, word filters, and an easy report/block system. No tolerance for hate speech, bullying, or creepy behavior. Why It’s Different: Most apps are either too anonymous (and get toxic fast) or too public (and stressful to be “seen” on). This strikes a balance: real people, real interests, and real friendships—but at your own pace and comfort level. The Ask: • What do you think of this idea? • Would you use an app like this at your school? • Is anyone into app dev or design and want to help me bring it to life? • Any tools you recommend for a beginner trying to prototype this? Thanks for reading! I’m excited (and a little nervous) to post this, but I think it could really help people who feel alone at school find their people.

Behavioral researchers estimate the average adult makes 35,000 choices a day. Strip away the big strategic stuff and you’re still left with hundreds of micro-decisions that burn willpower and time. A Deloitte survey clocked the typical knowledge worker at 30–60 minutes daily just dithering over lunch, streaming, or clothing—roughly 11 wasted days a year. After watching my own mornings evaporate in Swiggy scrolls and Netflix trailers, I started prototyping QuickDecision, an AI companion that handles only the *low-stakes, high-frequency* choices we all claim are “no big deal,” yet secretly drain us. The vision isn’t another super-app; it’s a single-purpose tool that gives you back cognitive bandwidth with zero friction. What it does *DM-level simplicity*—simple UI with a single user-input: 1. You type (or voice) a dilemma: “Lunch?”, “What to wear for 28 °C?”, “Need a 30-min podcast.” 2. The bot checks three data points: your stored preferences, contextual signals (time, weather, budget), and the feedback log of what you’ve previously accepted or rejected. 3. It returns one clear recommendation and two alternates ranked “in case.” Each answer is a single sentence plus a mini rationale—no endless carousels. 4. You tap 👍 or 👎. That’s the entire UX. Guardrails &amp; trust * Scope lock: The model never touches career, finance, or health decisions—only trivial, reversible ones. * Privacy: Preferences stay local to your user record; no data resold, no ads injected. * Transparency: Every suggestion comes with a one-line “why,” so you’re never blindly following a black box. Who benefits first? * Busy founders/leaders who want to preserve morning focus. * Remote teams drowning in “what’s for lunch?” threads. * Anyone battling ADHD or decision paralysis on routine tasks. Mission If QuickDecision can claw back even 15 minutes a day, that’s 90 hours of reclaimed creative or rest time each year. Multiply that by a team and you get serious productivity upside without another motivational workshop. That’s the idea on paper.

My competitors were getting name-dropped. My brand? Not even a blip. Even though I’ve been doing the usual SEO stuff like blog posts, backlinks, decent domain authority and it clearly didn’t translate into visibility in AI-generated responses. That got me thinking: 👉 What actually influences what brands show up in tools like ChatGPT, Claude, or Perplexity? 👉 How would you even measure your “AI visibility” if traditional SEO tools don’t help? So I started planning a tool tentatively called [Peekaboo](https://www.aipeekaboo.com/) that helps with what I’m calling Generative Search Optimization Here’s what I’m imagining so far: * You input your brand/product. * It runs a search across LLMs (via prompt APIs or scraping public interactions) to see if and where you get mentioned. * It scores your visibility and compares you to competitors. * Bonus: Suggests ways to increase mentions—maybe through context-rich content, forums, or Q&amp;A entries that LLMs train on. I’m still early in the idea phase and haven’t built anything yet. Curious if this kind of tool would be helpful to anyone else—especially solo founders or marketers worried about being invisible in the “AI answer layer” of the internet. Would love to hear: * Is this a problem you’ve noticed too? * If you’ve ever tried to boost your brand’s presence in LLMs, how’d you approach it? * What features would make something like this genuinely useful?

The app/webapp could be used for planning routes and trips, making notes, tracking the route that the user has taken (yes, your own location is also displayed), creating polls and potentially booking hotels and activities. Use case 1: you are planning a group trip with friends over Discord or any calling service. Instead of using a combination of spread sheets and google maps, you can use this webapp to work together in a map, highlighting places to visit, hotels to stay the night and which routes you'll take. While doing so, you'll see each other's cursor move around like in Miro and Figma (using websockets). You can make polls to decide on two different branches of a route and any associated activities or hotels. While on the trip, you will be able to use the app on your smartphone to see your current location with respect to your trip, attach images to locations, as well as share the progress with family at home (slightly similar to polar steps). Useful feature: when you lose your trip companions, their locations are also visible on this app. Use case 2: you have a custom map of a venue in which you are planning an event. You can upload this map to collaborate with others similarly to use case 1. As an additional feature, a heuristical algorithm (and if useful a bit of AI) will attempt to detect all roads and paths on your custom map. It will also connect these over multiple floors so that the route planner is able to make routes between locations on different floors. This may also be used by safety compliance officers to plan crowd control or evacuation, as well as serve as a tool to brainstorm ideas remotely between a wedding planner and spouses-to-be.

{"id": "1kb6mu9", "subreddit": "r/AppIdeas", "created_utc": 1745982688.0, "title": "Quizziu – Incentivized Trivia for Product Awareness", "selftext": "Overview: Quizziu is a mobile app that reimagines market research surveys by replacing boring questionnaires with engaging trivia questions about products and services. Respondents are paid small cash incentives for answering questions correctly, encouraging them to learn about brands while earning rewards. The app serves as a dual-purpose platform: it provides companies with a cost-effective marketing tool to boost product awareness, and it offers users a fun, gamified way to earn money while discovering new products. How Quizziu WorksApp Interface: The home screen displays a list of trivia questions, each tied to a specific product or service.Next to each question is the incentive amount (e.g., $0.10–$1.00) for answering correctly. Questions are categorized by industry (e.g., travel, tech, fashion) for easy navigation. Question Selection and Gameplay: Users tap a question to open a new screen showing the trivia question and four multiple-choice answers.Users have one chance to select the correct answer, promoting focus and retention of product details.If the answer is correct, the incentive is instantly credited to the user’s in-app wallet. If incorrect, the user can move on to another question but cannot retry the same one. A “Learn More” link is provided with each question, directing users to the brand’s website or a brief product summary for research before answering. Incentive and Payout System: Incentives range from $0.10 to $1.00 per question, depending on the complexity and the brand’s budget. Users can cash out earnings via PayPal, Venmo, or gift cards once they reach a minimum threshold (e.g., $5). To prevent gaming the system, Quizziu uses anti-cheat measures like randomized question delivery and time limits for answering. Brand Campaign Setup: Companies submit their campaign details, including product information, target audience, and budget. Quizziu’s team crafts 5–10 trivia questions per campaign, each designed to highlight key product features or benefits. Brands set the incentive amount per question and the number of respondents they want to reach. For example: Budget: $100,000, 10 questions, each with a $0.25 incentive. Target: 360,000 respondents (e.g., 36,000 per question) Questions are distributed across the user base, with algorithms ensuring demographic alignment (e.g., age, location, interests). Example Scenario Bob’s Luggage Company launches a new line with a built-in tracking device. They partner with Quizziu for a $100,000 campaign. Quizziu creates 10 trivia questions, such as: “What feature helps Bob’s new luggage prevent loss during travel?” A) Solar-powered charger B) Built-in tracking device C) Waterproof fabric D) Expandable compartments Incentive: $0.25 Nancy, a Quizziu user, sees the question in her app. Unsure of the answer, she clicks the “Learn More” link, visits Bob’s website, and reads about the tracking device. She returns, selects the correct answer (B), and earns $0.25. Weeks later, when her son’s luggage is lost during a trip, Nancy recalls the trivia question and buys Bob’s luggage as a birthday gift, directly influenced by her Quizziu experience. Unique Selling Points Engagement Over Boredom: Unlike traditional surveys, Quizziu’s trivia format is fun, quick, and rewarding, increasing user participation. Learning Through Incentives: The one-chance rule and research option encourage users to actively learn about products, improving brand recall. Cost-Effective Marketing: Brands pay only for correct answers, ensuring engagement with their message, and reach large audiences at a low cost per impression. Measurable Impact: Quizziu provides brands with analytics, including response rates, demographic breakdowns, and click-through rates to “Learn More” links. Scalable and Flexible: Campaigns can target niche or broad audiences, with adjustable budgets and incentive structures. Revenue Model: Quizziu charges brands a platform fee (e.g., 20% of the campaign budget) to cover question creation, distribution, and analytics. Additional premium services, like advanced targeting or custom question formats (e.g., video-based trivia), generate extra revenue. User-side monetization includes optional in-app purchases (e.g., premium question packs with higher incentives) or ad-supported free tiers. Potential Challenges and Solutions: Randomize answer order, impose time limits, and require a short delay before answering to encourage research. Ensuring brand trust in ROI. Provide detailed campaign reports and offer a small free trial campaign to demonstrate effectiveness. Gamify the experience with leaderboards, streaks, and bonus incentives for frequent participation. Social Sharing: Users can share trivia questions on social media, earning bonus incentives if friends join and answer correctly. AR Integration: For physical products, users can scan items in stores to unlock exclusive trivia questions. Loyalty Program: Users earn points for every question answered, redeemable for higher-value rewards or exclusive brand discounts. Impact Potential: Quizziu bridges the gap between market research and marketing, creating a win-win for brands and consumers. Brands gain a highly engaged audience, while users earn money and discover products they might genuinely need, as seen in Nancy’s purchase decision. With its scalable model, Quizziu could disrupt traditional survey platforms and become a go-to tool for product discovery in the digital age.", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/AppIdeas/comments/1kb6mu9/", "upvotes": 1, "num_comments": 0, "source": "pullpush_sub", "fetched_at": "2025-10-21T16:09:49Z"}

It took 10+ years of therapy and life coaching to start changing it. Learning to recognize and reshape the way I talked to myself made a huge difference in every part of my life. Recently, I tested giving one of the newer LLMs the same information I had shared with therapists and coaches. My life history, my fears, my self-judgments. I was honestly shocked at how well it was able to understand patterns and give meaningful advice. It is obviously not a replacement for therapy, but it is an incredible tool when used right. The app I want to build would focus on helping people map the voice in their head and develop a healthier relationship with it. The difference from other \"AI coach\" apps is that it would require serious upfront intake. Things like: * Voice-based prompts where users speak freely about major life events, fears, patterns, relationships, etc. * Deep analysis of how their inner voice talks to them * Personalized advice based on the full context of who they are Users would also be able to customize how their life coach responds. You could choose a voice that is more gentle and encouraging, or one that is more direct and challenging, depending on what you respond to best.

Tracking and splitting expenses, sharing flight information, and accommodation details can become cumbersome, often leading to repeated communication and frustration.

What if we have an app that does the following: **Eliminating spreadsheets and multiple apps** *tasks, activities, expenses, voting, and timelines are all in one place. **Focusing on collaboration** *assign tasks, vote on ideas, know who is on what flight and the timings, comments based discussions, and involve everyone equally. **Comprehensive logistics** *You can associate trip members with flights, hotel bookings, and more so everything is clear and accounted for.

I'm generally a big sports fan and attend football, handball and ice hockey matches. I think Futbology is okay in principle, but in terms of the UI and statistics, for example, the app doesn't even begin to realise its potential. My biggest problem by far is the focus on football. I would also like to log the handball and ice hockey games I attend, but unfortunately I haven't found anything similar to Futbology for other sports. Now it occurred to me whether it would be possible to programme my own app as a project. Personally, I have been working in the IT industry ever since my apprenticeship 10 years ago (first in a global software company and now at an IT service provider) in a wide variety of roles (first 1st level support, then customer success manager, then as a technical consultant in which I was responsible for the entire front end of a web planner and now as a technical sales manager). I have worked closely with developers for many years but never developed anything myself. My vision for this app would be that it should have a strong focus on the community and that data on games/leagues can be added by the community. The app should offer detailed statistics and a modern UI in general. I already have some ideas on how such an app could be designed. The fact that the app is intended for all team sports (perhaps also individual sports?) means that there is much greater potential worldwide than if you were to focus on one sport. Nevertheless, my goal is absolutely not to get rich or anything like that. I want to create a nice, honest, modern app with maybe 3-4 people who also want to do it. What do you think about it?

Rearranging things and the sort and what have yas with computer helpin'.(Ramble) Even Billy Bob could use it. An example would be you have a messy room and you want to clean and organize it. The app would use AI power/ algorithms to analyze what's in the video or photo (if easier and cheaper). While you're waiting for it to process the video, it can ask you questions (or beforehand) about how you would like your data presented to you. Simplified terms or detailed words with photo examples. The solution would be easy to understand and it would provide material lists or techniques that could be used. Like basic organizing techniques and materials that would help achieve your goal. If it data scrapes the internet of organizing tips that apply to the topic, then it can link resources and relevant videos of other people doing it. Pinterest boards, YouTube, how-to website, reddit. People will be able to start a project and name it, label it, organize the project. It can give you status completion reminders and congratulations. Incorporate a self-help feedback support system like Finch. It will reminder you to follow-up on projects. Some people might use it just for fun. Even organized areas could be \"reorganized.\" If it could show ai generated photos of what it could look like, that would be next level. There can be search links for the materials needed and where to get them. If you have troubles with motivation or get overwhelmed by tasks, this is for you.

Their job is simple: help make sure you actually follow through. This idea actually started with my mom. We were both trying to build a daily meditation habit, so we made a deal to text each other every day after our sessions. If one of us didn’t check in around the usual time, the other would nudge with something like, “Hey Mom, did you do your meditation today?” It worked surprisingly well, mainly because neither of us wanted to let the other person down. The app follows the same system: * Any habit you're assigned to as a partner shows up on your Partner Habits screen (screen 4). * If a habit isn’t marked complete by the scheduled time plus the reminder time, it becomes overdue. * When that happens, you tap **SEND REMINDER**, and it opens the native iOS Messages app with a pre-written nudge: “Hey {First Name}, did you do your meditation today?” Would genuinely love any feedback on the app idea itself and the design because I don't have a design bone in my body. **Screens:** **Screen 1** Main habit screen.

My primary goal is to reduce/hopefully stop eating chips altogether through this app and possibly help others get there too! For a while now I've been looking for a way to not only aggregate the amount of chips I eat, but also more specifically the cost (probably well over $1000 through my lifetime) and weight gained. I had tried out a few other food tracking tools like MyFitnessPal, but I realized those apps don't track cost and associated weight gain, mainly just calories. So, I thought to myself why not try and build an app that does that and more importantly an app that I would use. For now, the main features are: * Snack logging (name, portion, price, and calories) * Monthly overview (snacks eaten, money spent, weight gained) * **Yearly Projection (based on monthly stats)** I think one important principle that helps in reducing bad habits is awareness. So my aim with the yearly projection and logging is to promote awareness of my own habits.
